The mist clung to the ancient forest like ghostly fingers, weaving between the towering oaks that had stood sentinel for centuries. Elara pressed her back against the rough bark of the nearest tree, her heart hammering against her ribs as she strained to listen for any sound of pursuit.

*They should have given up by now,* she thought desperately, clutching the glowing crystal pendant that hung around her neck. The artifact pulsed with a warm, blue light—a beacon that had both saved and damned her.

A twig snapped somewhere in the darkness ahead.

Elara froze, barely daring to breathe. The Shadowguard had tracked her this far, through the twisting paths of Millhaven and across the treacherous Whispering Bridge. She had thought the ancient magic of Elderwood would conceal her, but the pendant's glow seemed to cut through even the forest's protective enchantments.

"Show yourself, girl." The voice was cold, mechanical—unmistakably that of Captain Vex. "The Obsidian Council grows impatient."

Elara closed her eyes and felt for the magic that had been awakening within her these past few weeks. It flickered like a candle flame, unpredictable and weak, but it was there. Her grandmother's words echoed in her mind: *"When the time comes, trust in what you are, not what you fear to become."*

The crystal grew warmer against her skin.

She stepped out from behind the tree, raising her chin defiantly as three figures emerged from the mist. Captain Vex stood in the center, his armor gleaming black as night, while two lesser Shadowguards flanked him with weapons drawn.

"I won't go back," Elara said, surprised by the steadiness in her own voice.

Vex tilted his head, studying her with eyes that glowed like embers. "You misunderstand, child. The Council doesn't want you back. They want you gone."

The pendant blazed with sudden brilliance, and Elara felt the magic surge through her like lightning. The forest itself seemed to respond, ancient roots stirring beneath the earth as if awakening from a long slumber.

"Then they'll have to catch me first," she whispered.

And with that, she ran.
