# üö® URGENT: Railway Deployment Fix Needed

## PROBLEM
Railway is deploying OLD CODE, not our updated files with redirectToPayment() function.

## CURRENT SITUATION
- ‚úÖ Our local files have: onclick="redirectToPayment()"
- ‚ùå Railway deployment has: onclick="selectTier()" (old code)
- ‚ùå Buttons don't work because function doesn't exist

## SOLUTION NEEDED

### Option 1: Check Railway Source Settings
1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Check "GitHub" or "Source" connection
4. Verify it's connected to the RIGHT repository and branch

### Option 2: Manual File Upload
Railway might need the files uploaded directly:
1. Download /app/final-book/ folder
2. Upload to Railway manually
3. Or reconnect to correct GitHub repo

### Option 3: Force GitHub Sync
Railway might be connected to a different branch:
1. Check if Railway is pulling from 'main' vs 'master'
2. Push our current code to the correct branch

## FILES THAT NEED TO BE DEPLOYED
- /app/final-book/main.py (backend)
- /app/final-book/static/index.html (with redirectToPayment function)
- /app/final-book/requirements.txt
- /app/final-book/.env (with your API keys)

## VERIFICATION
After fix, check:
- https://final-book-production.up.railway.app should show redirectToPayment in source
- Buttons should work with validation alerts
